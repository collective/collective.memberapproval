1.0b2 (unreleased)
------------------

- There are now three states: Pending, Approved, Disapproved. You can this
  way show all pending users. You can only approve or disapprove users, you
  can not make them pending once they have been approved or disapproved.
  
- Having an approval link in the tabs confused the users, so I removed it.
